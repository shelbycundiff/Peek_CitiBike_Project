# Peek_CitiBike_Project

##### Approach & Methods

1. Understand the two data sets presented via exploratory analysis queries
2. Work through key questions to help understand the environment CitiBike operates in
     -Analysis done outside of SQL (via Google Sheets) is stored in separate tabs in the Peek Assignment     Spreadsheet
   -Work to identify which Lat/Long pairs coordinate with each NYC Borough was done using Geocodio (free online tool)
4. Build out a forcast based on learnings in #2.
5. Apply forcast and analysis findings to a pricing strategy ideation session

### Key Findings Summary


### Details (Based on Task Numbers)

Task # 1:
1.For each bike ID, compute the longest streak of consecutive days it was used.

2. Which stations show the biggest difference between weekday and weekend usage?

3. How has the average trip duration changed month-over-month for the 20 busiest stations?

4.Classify each station-day into “Low”, “Medium”, or “High” demand based on trip volume percentiles. Then, analyze demand category distribution by borough.

5.On high-volume days (>90th percentile), do users ride longer or shorter trips? Does this differ by rider type?
